## Guide
### Usage for buildings
1. Import my package via Assets > Import Custom Package
1. Use the prefabs in the …/JustGlass
1. Place your glass in the …/Object/Windows GameObject(preference, not required).
1. The glass does not need to be in the Parent Object’s LOD Group as it has its own

## Optional Configuration
  Change the Bounds size of each Glass LOD Group to conform more to the shape
